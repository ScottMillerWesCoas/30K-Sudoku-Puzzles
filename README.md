# 30K Sudoku Puzzles
30K puzzles in three different difficulty tiers and a calming video bg to help you keep your cool 

## Notes
- [ ] Built with Node.js (thanks for writing 10K puzzles for each difficulty into the proper format lickety-split, node!), HTML5/CSS3, a lil' jQuery
- [ ] Built the background Youtube player in Javascript for a calming bg while you play
- [ ] Switching boards using AJAX so the video player doesn't reload each time you switch to a new board
- [ ] Built win/loss check functionality in Javascript as well
